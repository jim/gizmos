# Gismos

A collection of JavaScript utilities and sub-libraries I've built over the course of many projects. Nothing really big enough to live on it's own, at least yet.

Docs are in READMEs or in comments at the top of each file.

I know a lot of folks don't like deep namespacing. I don't really either, but there comes a time when you have to be responsible at the expense of conciseness.

Feedback is welcome, you can reach me at jim at autonomousmachine dot com.
